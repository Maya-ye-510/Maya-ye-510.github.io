    <h1>About this website</h1>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">This is a website that offers different styles of movies based on colors. In this site, the home page simulates the feeling of being in a movie theater, allowing the audience to choose a movie based only on the icon and color without knowing what to expect. This also relates to my intension of combine the idea of "blind box" in the website. Entry each link, it brings up titles, details, pictures, and music about the movie of that color. The layout and design element of the entry makes it easy for the audience to understand the logic of each movie's color choice and the feelings it is trying to convey. In order to provide more choices, the “More!” option also sets up an interface similar to the sliding selection of movies and sorts them by color, so that viewers can directly feel the relationship between the movie and the use of color. The whole website helps people to know more about movies and fits with my idea of sharing my love of movies to others.</p>
