    <div class = "description">Coco follows Miguel, a young boy who dreams of becoming a musician in a family that has banned music for generations. On D√≠a de los Muertos, he accidentally finds himself in the Land of the Dead, where he encounters his ancestors and learns about their stories. As Miguel navigates this colorful and enchanting world, he seeks to understand his family's past and reconnect with his passion for music. The film beautifully weaves themes of family, memory, and the significance of honoring those who have passed away, all set against a backdrop of vibrant visuals and heartfelt music.</div>
