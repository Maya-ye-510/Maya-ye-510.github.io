            Like as the waves make towards the pebbl'd shore, <br>
            So do our minutes hasten to their end; <br>
            Each changing place with that which goes before, <br>
            In sequent toil all forwards do contend. <br>
            Nativity, once in the main of light, <br>
            Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd, <br>
            Crooked eclipses 'gainst his glory fight, <br>
            And Time that gave doth now his gift confound. <br>
            Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth <br>
            And delves the parallels in beauty's brow, <br>
            Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth, <br>
            And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow: <br>
            And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand, <br>
            Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand. <br>

            You can't touch the same water twice;<br>

            That truly warms your heart and mind.<br>
            <br>
            The days are like a flowing stream,<br>
            Hours come and then they are gone;<br>
            Minutes and seconds really count,<br>
            Superbly spent under the sun.<br>
            <br>
            Give glory to the Almighty,<br>
            Offer praises to the Father;<br>

            <br>
            There were so many yesterday's<br>
            I let just flow away.<br>

            To allow me one more day.<br>
            I can only work this one today<br>
            Tomorrow may never come.<br>
            But if it comes will I be ready<br>
            To seize it by the horns?<br>
            <br>
            I never more will pass it by<br>
            And let it flit away.<br>
            I will treasure each moment that comes my way<br>

            I want to age like sea glass, smoothed by tides, not broken.<br>
            I want the currents of life to toss me around, shake me up<br>
            And leave me feeling washed clean. I want my hard edges to<br>
            soften as the years pass — made not weak, but supple.<br>
            I want to ride the waves, go with flow, feel the impact of the<br>
            surging tides rolling in and out.<br>
            <br>
            When I am thrown against the shore and caught between the rocks<br>
            I want to rest there until I can find the strength to do what is next.<br>
            Not stuck — just waiting, pondering, feeling what it feels like to pause.<br>
            And when I am ready, I will catch a wave and let it carry me along to<br>
            the next place that I am supposed to be.<br>
            <br>
            I want to age like sea glass. When people see the old woman I'll become,<br>
            They'll embrace all that I am. They'll marvel at my exquisite nature,<br>
            hold me gently in their hands and be awed by my well-earned patina —<br>
            neither flashy nor dull — but just the right luster. And we'll both feel lucky<br>
            to realize, once again, that we have landed in the perfectly right place<br>
            at just the right moment.<br>
            <br>
            I want to age like sea glass. I want to enjoy the journey and let my<br>
            preciousness be, not in spite of the impacts of life, but because of them.
