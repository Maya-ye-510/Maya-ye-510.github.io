Their romance blossoms amidst the stark differences in their social classes, set against the backdrop of the shipâ€™s luxurious yet tragic journey. The film explores themes of love, sacrifice, and the struggles between social classes, all while capturing the grandeur and eventual disaster of the Titanic.
